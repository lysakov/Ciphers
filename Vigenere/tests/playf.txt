The Playfair cipher or Playfair square or Wheatstone-Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric 
encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher.
The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair 
for promoting its use. 
The first well-documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher was formulated by Leon 
Battista Alberti around 1467 and used a metal cipher disc to switch between cipher 
alphabets. Alberti's system only switched alphabets after several words, and switches were 
indicated by writing the letter of the corresponding alphabet in the ciphertext. Later, in 
1508, Johannes Trithemius, in his work poligraphia, invented the tabula recta, a critical 
component of the vigen√®re cipher. The Trithemius cipher, however, only provided a 
progressive, rigid and predictable system for switching between cipher alphabets.[citation
