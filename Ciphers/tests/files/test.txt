THE FIRST WELL-DOCUMENTED DESCRIPTION OF A POLYALPHABETIC CIPHER WAS FORMULATED BY LEON 
BATTISTA ALBERTI AROUND 1467 AND USED A METAL CIPHER DISC TO SWITCH BETWEEN CIPHER 
ALPHABETS. ALBERTI'S SYSTEM ONLY SWITCHED ALPHABETS AFTER SEVERAL WORDS, AND SWITCHES WERE 
INDICATED BY WRITING THE LETTER OF THE CORRESPONDING ALPHABET IN THE CIPHERTEXT. LATER, IN 
1508, JOHANNES TRITHEMIUS, IN HIS WORK POLIGRAPHIA, INVENTED THE TABULA RECTA, A CRITICAL 
COMPONENT OF THE VIGENÈRE CIPHER. THE TRITHEMIUS CIPHER, HOWEVER, ONLY PROVIDED A 
PROGRESSIVE, RIGID AND PREDICTABLE SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING BETWEEN CIPHER ALPHABETS.[CITATION

WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE VIGENÈRE CIPHER WAS ORIGINALLY DESCRIBED BY GIOVAN BATTISTA 
BELLASO IN HIS 1553 BOOK LA CIFRA DEL SIG. GIOVAN BATTISTA BELLASO.[4] HE BUILT UPON THE 
TABULA RECTA OF TRITHEMIUS BUT ADDED A REPEATING "COUNTERSIGN" (A KEY) TO SWITCH CIPHER 
ALPHABETS EVERY LETTER. WHEREAS ALBERTI AND TRITHEMIUS USED A FIXED PATTERN OF 
SUBSTITUTIONS, BELLASO'S SCHEME MEANT THE PATTERN OF SUBSTITUTIONS COULD BE EASILY 
CHANGED, SIMPLY BY SELECTING A NEW KEY. KEYS WERE TYPICALLY SINGLE WORDS OR SHORT PHRASES,
 KNOWN TO BOTH PARTIES IN ADVANCE, OR TRANSMITTED "OUT OF BAND" ALONG WITH THE MESSAGE. 
BELLASO'S METHOD THUS REQUIRED STRONG SECURITY FOR ONLY THE KEY. AS IT IS RELATIVELY EASY 
TO SECURE A SHORT KEY PHRASE, SUCH AS BY A PREVIOUS PRIVATE CONVERSATION, BELLASO'S SYSTEM
 WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE SECURE.[CITATION NEEDED]
BLAISE DE VIGENÈRE PUBLISHED HIS DESCRIPTION OF A SIMILAR BUT STRONGER AUTOKEY CIPHER 
BEFORE THE COURT OF HENRY III OF FRANCE, IN 1586.[5] LATER, IN THE 19TH CENTURY, THE 
INVENTION OF BELLASO'S CIPHER WAS MISATTRIBUTED TO VIGENÈRE. DAVID KAHN, IN HIS BOOK, THE 
CODEBREAKERS LAMENTED THE MISATTRIBUTION BY SAYING THAT HISTORY HAD "IGNORED THIS 
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION AND INSTEAD NAMED A REGRESSIVE AND ELEMENTARY CIPHER FOR HIM 
[VIGENÈRE] THOUGH HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT".[6]
THE VIGENÈRE CIPHER GAINED A REPUTATION FOR BEING EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG. NOTED AUTHOR AND 
MATHEMATICIAN CHARLES LUTWIDGE DODGSON (LEWIS CARROLL) CALLED THE VIGENÈRE CIPHER 
UNBREAKABLE IN HIS 1868 PIECE "THE ALPHABET CIPHER" IN A CHILDREN'S MAGAZINE. IN 1917, 
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN DESCRIBED THE VIGENÈRE CIPHER AS "IMPOSSIBLE OF TRANSLATION".[7][8] 
THAT REPUTATION WAS NOT DESERVED. CHARLES BABBAGE IS KNOWN TO HAVE BROKEN A VARIANT OF THE 
CIPHER AS EARLY AS 1854 BUT FAILED TO PUBLISH HIS WORK.[9] KASISKI ENTIRELY BROKE THE 
CIPHER AND PUBLISHED THE TECHNIQUE IN THE 19TH CENTURY, BUT EVEN EARLIER, SOME SKILLED 
CRYPTANALYSTS COULD OCCASIONALLY BREAK THE CIPHER IN THE 16TH CENTURY.[6]
